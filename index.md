I am currently a junior major in **data science** in **University of Science and Technology of China** (USTC). Before that, I lived in Canton for over 15 years. I like delicious food, gym and classic musics! After studying in the school of data science, I found my interest in the research of machine learning, and I am now doing research on the use of deep learning in **cognitive diagnosis**, which is part of an intelligent education system.

## About my research
### Cognitive diagnosis and its application in intelligent education
The research focuses on the use of deep learning in **cognitive diagnosis**, which is part of an intelligent education system. Given student list and students' performance record (including course video watching record, exam answer record, etc.), I research on how to model students and predict their future performance (i.e. score in exams).
