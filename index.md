## About me
* Email: satosasara[AT]mail[dot]ustc[dot]edu[dot]cn

I am currently a sophomore major in **data science** in **University of Science and Technology of China**(USTC). Before that, I lived in Canton for 15 years. I like delicious food, gym and classic musics! After studying in the school of data science, I found my interest in the research of machine learning, and I am now doing research on the use of deep learning in **cognitive diagnosis**, which is part of an intelligent education system.
